This is a simple standalone application that talks to the
"i2pcontrol" jsonrpc interface on I2P routers.

Current setup:
* Build itoopie:
    Dependencies: ant, Java SDK
    'ant' in the i2p.itoopie directory
* Run:
    Dependencies: Java runtime and an I2P router that supports the jsonrpc interface
    java -jar dist/itoopie.jar

The router jsonrpc interface is configured by default for https at localhost:7650.
7650 is the default port for i2pd and the old Java router console "i2pcontrol" plugin.

For i2pd, the jsonrpc interface is off by default.
You must set i2pcontrol.enabled=true in i2pd.conf.
See https://i2pd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/#i2pcontrol-interface
for more information and other options.

The Java router console now bundles the jsonrpc interface by default
as a webapp on port 7657, and the i2pcontrol plugin is no longer necessary.
You may disable or remove the plugin at http://localhost:7657/configplugins
The jsonrpc webapp is off by default.
To start it, go to http://localhost:7657/configwebapps and start the
"jsonrpc" webapp. To always run it, click the "Run at Startup" setting
and click "Save WebApp Configuration".
You MUST change itoopie's "I2P Node port" to 7657 to connect to the jsonrpc webapp.
itoopie will automatically use http for port 7657.
If the console is on another port, it is assumed to be HTTPS, and you
must add "server.target=jsonrpc/" to the config file ~/.itoopie/itoopie.conf
